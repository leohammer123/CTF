# Php is weak
### 1. Take a look at the source code. There is a strange comment.
```html 
    <!-- frpergnybat.gkg-->
```
### 2. It looks like a file name after some *rot encode*.
```secretalong.txt```
### 3. In the /secretalong.txt file.
Don't tell anyone about that!! Okay??
admin_gmail: "admin@gmail.com"
admin_password: "secret_password_12345789!!!"
Btw "Remember me" button is important for me because i forgot my creds always.
### 4. Use the password in the file to log in.
![]()
### 5. The flag is in the cookie with *base64 encoded*.
