```php 
function print_credentials() { /* {{{ */
    if($_SESSION and array_key_exists("admin", $_SESSION) and $_SESSION["admin"] == 1) {
    print "You are an admin. The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
    print "<pre>Username: natas22\n";
    print "Password: <censored></pre>";
    } else {
    print "You are logged in as a regular user. Login as an admin to retrieve credentials for natas22.";
    }
}
```
## In the experimenter page
```php
if(array_key_exists("submit", $_REQUEST)) {
    foreach($_REQUEST as $key => $val) {
    $_SESSION[$key] = $val;
    }
}
```
If you wanna trigger print_credentials(), you have to have a pair of value admin:1, so in the experimenter page you can post some data,and it'll sotre in your session,you can either use burp or postname to post the request,then get the origin page with the same session id.
